As episodes progress, there is a noticeable improvement in the average reward, transitioning from negative to positive values, which suggests that the learning algorithm starts to find and exploit successful strategies. After the initial improvement, the average rewards per 100 episodes stabilize around values slightly above 7, indicating that the model has likely converged to a stable policy."

However, combination 4 could have been exploring less optimally or settling into suboptimal policies due to other factors such as the high learning rate and low discount factor which indicates their significance and how much those factors matter as well than compared to just total episodes. High learning rate (0.7), speeds up the policy updates significantly. This can be advantageous in dynamic environments but risky as it may cause the policy to converge prematurely or oscillate without stabilizing.
